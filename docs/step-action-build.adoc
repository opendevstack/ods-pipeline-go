== Parameters

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Parameter | Default | Description

| working-dir
| .
| Working directory. The path must be relative to the root of the repository,
without leading `./` and trailing `/`.



| enable-cgo
| false
| Whether to enable CGO. When not enabled the build will set `CGO_ENABLED=0`.


| go-os
| linux
| `GOOS` variable (the execution operating system such as `linux`, `windows`).


| go-arch
| amd64
| `GOARCH` variable (the execution architecture such as `arm`, `amd64`).


| output-dir
| docker
| Path to the directory into which the resulting Go binary should be copied, relative to `working-dir`. This directory may then later be used as Docker context for example.


| cache-build
| true
| If enabled tasks uses or populates cache with the output dir contents (and artifacts) so that a build can be skipped if the `working-dir` contents did not change. You must set this to `"false"` if the build can be affected by files outside `working-dir`. See ADR caching-build-tasks for more details and workarounds.


| build-extra-inputs
| 
| List of build source directories (as colon separated string) which in addition working-dir influence the build. These directories are relative to the repository root. If the contents in these directories change the cache is invalidated so that the build task will rebuild from scratch.


| build-reused-from-location-path
| 
| The cache location that the build task used. If caching is not enabled this will be an empty string.


| build-script
| /usr/local/bin/go-build-script
| Build script to execute. The link:https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline-go/blob/main/build/images/scripts/build.sh[default script] is located in the container image. If you specify a relative path instead, it will be resolved from the workspace. See the task definition for details how the build script is invoked.


| pre-test-script
| 
| Script to execute before running tests, relative to the working directory.


| private-cert
| 
| Volume mount name


| debug
| false
| Whether to turn on debug mode


| workspace
| 
| Path to workspace
